## Never plan for fun again. Just have it. Now, with CityCrawler.

While squabbling over bars to visit in the city, we pined for a solution to our problem.

And here we find CityCrawler, an app that takes your interests and a couple of other details to immediately plan your ideal trip. So whether it's a pub crawl or a night full of entertainment, CityCrawler will be at your service to help you decide and focus on the conversations that actually matter.

With CityCrawler you can also share your plan with your friends, so no one is left behind.

##Tech Used
On the iOS side, we used RxSwift, and RxAlamoFire to handle asynchronous tasks and network requests.

On the Android side, we used Kotlin, RxKotlin, Retrofit and OkHTTP.

Our backend system consists of a set of stdlib endpoint functions, which are built using the Google Maps Places API, Distance Matrix API, and the Firebase API. We also wrote a custom algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem based on Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm and the Depth First Tree Tour algorithm.

We have also exposed our Firebase and Google Maps stdlib functions to the public to contribute to that ecosystem. Oh and #OneMoreThing.
